1. Code Examples from Lab-5:

   a. process_creation.c (Exercise 1: Using fork() in C)
      This program creates a child process with fork(). Fork duplicates the parent; pid=0 in child, >0 in parent, <0 on fail. Child prints its PID, parent prints its.
      Output: 
      This is the parent process. PID: 1
      This is the child process. PID: 2
      (PIDs vary; order random due to scheduling.)
      Compile: gcc process_creation.c -o process_creation
      Run: ./process_creation

   b. file1.c and file2.c (Exercise 5: Role of the Linker)
      Separate files: file1 defines hello() which prints a message; file2 declares and calls it in main.
      Linker combines them into one executable.
      Output: Hello from file1!
      Compile: gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program
      Run: ./output_program
      Modify file1 (e.g., change message), recompile—output updates.

   c. simple_program.c (Exercise 6: Role of the Loader)
      Simple printf program; loader loads dynamic libs like libc at runtime.
      Output: This is a simple program.
      Compile: gcc simple_program.c -o simple_program
      Run: ./simple_program
      Check libs: ldd simple_program (shows libc.so.6, etc.)

2. Job of the Linker:
   Combines object files (.o) and libs into an executable. Resolves symbols (e.g., links hello() call to definition) and relocates addresses for memory.

3. Job of the Loader:
   OS loads executable into memory, sets up environment (stack, heap), loads dynamic libs, and jumps to main(). Handles runtime deps like printf.
